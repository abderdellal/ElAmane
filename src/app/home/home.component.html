  But before that he has to create a new form in the add form view and configure which place holders take which columns, he also has to specify the search column that he's going to use, to search for a specific line.<br/><br/>
  When configuring a new form the user can specify if the first line of the excel table is the header, if this is the case, he can use the autofetch from headers button to generate new placeholders with their respective columns so that he can use them in his .doc document.<br/><br/>
